# **BRR** does work on the current version of the game

# BombRushRadio
A Bomb Rush Cyberfunk mod that lets you add custom music into the game!

## How to use

Launch the game once, then navigate to your games root directory, go into **"Bomb Rush Cyberfunk_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods/BombRushRadio/Songs/"** which the mod should have created, then drag your songs into that folder. Make sure it's a supported audio format.

### Supported Audio Formats
- AIF(F)
- IT
- MOD
- MP2
- MP3
- OGG
- S3M
- WAV
- XM
- FLAC

It should look like this:

You can also use folders, like this:

# Config

```
## Settings file was created by plugin Bomb Rush Radio! v1.4
## Plugin GUID: kade.bombrushradio

[Audio]

## Shuffles the music that gets added by Bomb Rush Radio.
## Also makes song reloading act like a makeshift shuffle button. (excluding game songs)
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Shuffle = false

## Caches audio to disk.
## Pros: Memory is lowered significantly, any boot time after the first start is lowered significantly.
## Cons: Stutters on play (depending on audio size), caching on disk can be expensive on storage. (depending on audio size/format)
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Caching = false

## Preloads cached audio from disk.
## Causes slightly longer boot with memory usage increasing like without cache, but prevents stuttering when a song plays.
## Requires Caching to be enabled.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
PreloadCache = false

```

## Installation

### [THUNDERSTORE (CAN BE USED ON R2MODMAN)](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/Kade/BombRushRadio/)

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Kade-github/BombRushRadio/releases/latest), and download either:

### BepInEx Included

A version of the mod with BepInEx included.

**Drag'N'Drop the contents of the zip inside of your games root directory**

# STEAM DECK USERS

For it to work, you must use this launch property in steam: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%`



## Reloading

Want to reload songs on the fly? Make some changes in the song folder and press **F1** in game, it'll load any deletions/additions you make! (Not changes to files though)

## Building

Create a Publicized Assembly of the game, through anything (I used BepInEx's one, oh and I can't provide this because its a paid game)

(put that file in the root directory, called "Assembly-CSharp.dll")

And then open the .sln.

Make sure to add "https://nuget.bepinex.dev/v3/index.json" as a NuGet source. (in rider heres how it looks)

Then just build it.
